# -Exploring-Student-Behavior-Performance-with-Data-Science
Overview
This data science project investigates the relationship between student behavior, lifestyle choices, and academic performance using real-world inspired educational datasets. The analysis combines data wrangling, visualization, and structured querying to uncover actionable insights for educators, institutions, and researchers.
🎯 Objectives

    Understand how behavioral factors (e.g., social media use, Netflix habits, mental health) affect academic scores

    Analyze demographic and environmental influences such as age, gender, parental education, and internet quality

    Visualize key metrics and trends to support data-driven interventions in education

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

    Python: Data cleaning, merging, and transformation with Pandas

    Matplotlib & Seaborn: Custom visualizations and multivariate plots

    PostgreSQL: Querying and modeling structured student data

    Dimensional Modeling: Implemented both Star and Snowflake Schemas for analytical querying

🧱 Data Architecture
📌 Fact Table:

    student_performance: Contains exam scores, study hours, social media usage, etc.

📌 Dimension Tables:

    student_demographics: Age, gender, location

    parent_education: Education levels of mother/father

    internet_quality: Bandwidth, stability indicators

    lifestyle_factors: Exercise frequency, mental health, Netflix usage

📊 Dashboard Insights

    Study hours vs. exam performance

    Impact of social media and Netflix on academic outcomes

    Gender and age distribution of students

    Correlation between internet quality and learning effectiveness

    Mental wellness vs. attendance patterns

    Parental education's role in student success

🌐 Why It Matters

This project is a foundational step toward leveraging AI, BI, and Education Analytics to improve academic outcomes. By incorporating holistic, behavioral, and environmental dimensions, it provides a well-rounded perspective for policy-making and personalized support strategies.
